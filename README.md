A `magical device` for your elf on the shelf.  So unique it will create it's own landing strip...

Many homes have a little helper show up in December.  That little helper deserves a small tablet size device if elf's very own.

Using the basic dual-mono-chrome mini display kits from ebay/amazon, and an ESP8266 mini, you can give elf just that.

The code shared in this repo is ready for your wifi setup, and will display it's IP on boot.  Record the IP and access with a browser.

You can then put up quirky messages to get your younger kids their elf magic.  Inspired by mithril and that knotts berry farm jail bird.
