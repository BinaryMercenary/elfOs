# elfOs
A `magical device` for your elf on the shelf.  So unique it will create its own landing strip...

Many homes have a little helper show up in December.  That little helper deserves a small tablet size device if elf's very own.

Using the basic dual-mono-chrome mini display kits from ebay/amazon, and an ESP8266 mini, you can give elf just that.

The code shared in this repo is ready for your wifi setup, and will display it's IP on boot.  Record the IP and access with a browser.

You can then put up quirky messages into the web server's form to display magical elfy messages for your younger kids.  Inspired by the way parents use that knotts berry farm jail bird (and of course, mithril).

Background/BOM: Last year I designed an IOT controller to economize when whole house fan runs. 
I had a tiny lcd laying around from the initial kit (amazon asin B06Y5VHVFY). 
I attached it to a spare esp8266 (asin B010N1SPRK) and had everything I needed.
